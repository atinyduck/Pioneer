# Pioneer
Pioneer is a Unity WebGL game for ages 14-17 that gamifies Computer Science. Players program drones to solve logic and data structure puzzles, bridging the gap between visual blocks and Python code via Brython. It’s a zero-install, interactive experience designed to inspire future coders and showcase the creative side of programming.
